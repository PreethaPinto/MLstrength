# ML STRENGTH

I developed this project as part of my assignment for my Diploma in Information Technology at TAFE.

This website has 5 pages. It has been designed to run as a `single page application` (SPA) using the fragment identifier (routes equivalent in Angular and React). The pages are dynamically loaded from the server based on the route using Javascript.

The website has been designed to be responsive in mobile, tablet, desktop and large screens using `flex` and `media queries`. 

Vendor prefixes have been added to enable cross browser support. It is also `WCAG 2.1 Level-AA` compliant to ensure accessibility across all user base.

Semantic elements have been used wherever possible and the styles target specific semantic elements.

The website is hosted on github pages.
