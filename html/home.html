    <h1>No Obligation, No Pressure</h1>
    <br>
    <article>
      We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world
      does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for
      themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility
      than something that a marketing machine dreams up.  You are always welcome to look through any of
      our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling &#39;health club&#39; sales
      consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that.
      Our &#39;no obligation, no pressure&#39; attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.

      We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our
      valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
      We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends &amp; public holidays. WE
      ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night
      workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class times
      change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.
