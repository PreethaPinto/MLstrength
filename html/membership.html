  <h2>About the owner and his philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing, I competed as
    an amateur in my early years and now like to share my knowledge and
    expertise as a coach. It is unknown for me to jump into the ring as your
    sparring partner.

  <p>
    The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly energised.

  <p>
    Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer, you
    will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best cardiovascular
    workouts available.
