      <p>
        We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of
        the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying
        telemarketers or membership consultants. Pur gyms speak for themselves,
        our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more
        credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up. You are
        always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, no
        pressure whatsover. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants
        hustling you at every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing
        change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly
        evident with our $10 casual rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that
        passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old
        school feel with a new school attitude!
      </p>
      <p>
        We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays,
        weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7
        gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a
        protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for
        you. Our class times are constantly changing, so check out in the
        website for the timetanle at each of our clubs.
