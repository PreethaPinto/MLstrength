    <p class="about-us-details">
      We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of
      the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying
      telemarketers or membership consultants. Pur gyms speak for themselves,
      our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more
      credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up. You are
      always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, no
      pressure whatsover. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants
      hustling you at every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing
      change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly
      evident with our $10 casual rate.
    </p>
    <p class="about-us-details">
      We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion
      and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel
      with a new school attitude!
    </p>
    <p class="about-us-details">
      We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends
      & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are
      staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or
      shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class times
      are constantly changing, so check out in the website for the timetanle at
      each of our clubs.
